-> implement percentage improvement for wpm and error count
    -> the font color for wpm should change to green when wpm increase
        and red when vice versa andn same case with error count in reverse
    -> add text for wpm and error count to indicate them
-> create some more code snippets from python as well
-> create text with repeated words which are harder to write faster both in
    code and in general
-> implement a button that could take some input string and create a long text
    to practice on the go
